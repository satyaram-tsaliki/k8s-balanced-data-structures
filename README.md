# 🌳 Hierarchical and Balanced Data Structures in Kubernetes

## 📝 Abstract
This study presents an optimized implementation of **ETCD**, the core distributed key-value store of Kubernetes, using hierarchical and balanced data structures. It evaluates the performance of **Logarithmic Height Trees (LHTREE)** and **B-Trees** in Kubernetes ETCD clusters. By leveraging the Go language for implementing these structures, the research demonstrates significant improvements in **data insertion**, **deletion**, **search operations**, and **CPU utilization**. Experimental evaluations with Kubernetes clusters ranging from three to ten nodes revealed that B-Trees outperform LHTREEs, offering better scalability and reduced CPU overhead while maintaining optimal time and space complexities.
